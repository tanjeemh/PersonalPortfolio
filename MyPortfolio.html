            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              Hi! I'm Tanjeem and welcome to my portfolio! I use this platform to 
              log my career and give anyone who is interested a chance to learn about me!
            </p>
            <p>
              My favourite hobbies include anything basketball related, music, and technology.
              I support the Toronto Raptors, but my favourite player is LeBron James. I love 
              a wide variety of music ranging from Hip-Hop to RnB, and my favourite artist of
              all time would have to be JAY-Z. Growing up I was always fascinated with technology
              and learning how it all works. Once I was introducted to various coding languages and
              all the different things I could do, I fell in love with programming! This passion is what
              has brought me to the University of Waterloo! I am a 2nd year Management Engineering student in my 
              third study term.

              Fun fact! I've been programing for
